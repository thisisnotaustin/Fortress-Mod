Changes

Gameplay
- Sprinting and fast swimming have been removed.
HUD
- The food bar is removed.
- Added an armor toughness display to the armor bar.
- The armor bar is right-aligned, above the steed health bar.
- The air meter is left-aligned, above the player health bar.
Blocks
- Blast Furnaces and Smokers burn fuel 3x as fast as a normal Furnace while still smelting items only 2x as fast. This makes them faster, but less fuel-efficient.
Mobs
- Zombies (and all derivative mobs) have randomly increased movement speed and knock-back resistance. Zombies with greater movement speed will have less knock-back resistance.
- All Zombies (and derivative mobs) can now break wooden doors on Normal or Hard difficulty.
- All Villagers killed by Zombies (or derivative mobs) are guaranteed to zombify regardless of chance or difficulty.
- Zombie Villagers do not burn in daylight.
