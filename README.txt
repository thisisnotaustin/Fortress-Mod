Changes

Gameplay
- Hunger, saturation, sprinting, and fast swimming have all been removed.
- Eating food restores health over time. Different food items will restore different amounts of health and at different speeds.
- You can eat food so long as you are not currently healing from eating food.

HUD
- The food bar is no longer displayed.
- Added an armor toughness display to the armor bar.
- The armor bar is right-aligned, above the steed health bar.
- The air meter is left-aligned, above the player health bar.

Status Effects
- If the player is Hungry, eating food will only restore half as much health (rounded up). This is denoted by green refill hearts.

Blocks
- Blast Furnaces and Smokers burn fuel 3x as fast as a normal Furnace while still smelting items only 2x as fast. This makes them faster, but less fuel-efficient.

Mobs
- Zombies (and all derivative mobs) have randomly increased movement speed and knock-back resistance. Zombies with greater movement speed will have less knock-back resistance.
- All Zombies (and derivative mobs) can now break wooden doors on Normal or Hard difficulty.
- All Villagers killed by Zombies (or derivative mobs) are guaranteed to zombify regardless of chance or difficulty.
- Zombie Villagers do not burn in daylight.
